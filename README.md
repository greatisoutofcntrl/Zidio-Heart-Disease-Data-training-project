# Zidio-Heart-Disease-Data-training-project
This project is to explore diffrent data traing algorithms to give a highly trained data for heart disease prediction. Hosted by Zidio 
During the course of this project i was able to understand various ways in handling data in a data set and how to fill up Null values by getting thier mean or dropping tables when necessary
I used different training models to train the data set and realised Random forest Classifier was the best in training this model giving a 93% accuracy
Finally i built a predictive system to enable the model predict people with a heart problem or not based on the existing data values to the target value
This course has been a great first time experience with google collab and i am glad i could pick up some knowledge over this course, Though perfection is not yet attained i believe with constant practice i would attain more success rate in training my models. Thank You Zidio
